# About Me

Hi! I'm Rishika, a passionate roboticist and engineer with a strong foundation in mechanical design, control systems, and software development.

## Background

I'm currently focused on developing innovative robotic solutions that combine hardware design with intelligent software. My expertise spans across:

- **Robotics & Control Systems**: Designing and programming robotic arms, manipulators, and autonomous systems
- **Mechanical Design**: Using tools like Solidworks and Onshape for CAD and 3D modeling
- **Software Development**: Python, MATLAB, Arduino, and ROS/ROS2 for robot programming
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV for perception and visual feedback systems
- **Simulation**: Creating accurate simulations for testing and validation

## Projects

On this portfolio, you'll find some of my key projects including:

- **Underwater Manipulator**: A simulation and control system for underwater robotic arms
- **Mrs. Catfisher - The Bug Sorter**: An autonomous system using the Franka Arm to catch and sort moving objects
- **RRT Algorithm Implementation**: Motion planning using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees
- **Jack-in-a-Box**: An interactive robotic project combining mechanical design with control

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, C++
- **Robotics**: ROS2, MoveIt, Gazebo
- **CAD**: Solidworks, Onshape
- **Microcontrollers**: Arduino
- **Vision**: OpenCV
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
