# About Me

Hi! I'm Rishika, a graduate student in the M.S. Robotics program at Northwestern University. I completed my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Jodhpur, and I'm passionate about developing intelligent robotic solutions with a focus on LLMs and autonomous systems.

My interests span across robotics, control systems, and the intersection of AI and mechanical engineering. I'm particularly excited about exploring how large language models can enhance robot autonomy and human-robot interaction in complex, real-world environments.
